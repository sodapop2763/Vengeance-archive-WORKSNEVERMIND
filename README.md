# How to use:
Copy the code in Vengeance-code and right click your bookmark bar. There should be an |Add page...| option. click that, and in where you would input the URL, paste the code into that area. Rename the bookmark if you want, press save, and you now you have the bookmarklet. And now when you click on it, some options should appear on screen.

__Note:__ I realize that this may not work after looking at the code, and I'm sorry if so. This is just what I have, and it works for me, but I'm not sure if it works for everyone else. 

Update: browncha prob removed the thing the code depends on and now doesnt work. im sorry if this inconvieniced anyone
